# AWK

## Introduction

 This repository is a notebook for my progress in AWK programming language. AWK is important for those which want to be a modern back-end developer and automatize his tasks with Terminal.
 Here, I use GNU AWK in Ubuntu 20.04.

## Installation

 For installing AWK, first check if you have it in your machine with this following command:
> awk --version
 
 If you don't have, install using:
 ### Ubuntu
> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gawk

 ### macOS
> brew install gawk
